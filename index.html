           <p>I’m a quick-witted worker who doesn’t believe in saying “no,” without taking a stab at it. With two summer internships under my belt I’ve worked with a diverse group of high-profile organizations including the DC Jazz Festival, March of Dimes, Vertex, Nvidia, Rosslyn BID, and Government Marketing University. This experience taught me that executing PR objectives, and brainstorming marketing tactics requires creativity, confidence, and a whole lot of strategic-thinking.</p>

           <p>As an undergraduate at Virginia Tech I’ve committed myself to being fully present in the organizations I’ve designated my time to. I quickly joined the Public Relations Student Society of America when I arrived three years ago, and have worked on the public relations committee (<i>Ut Prosim</i> PR) since. I was also a member of Delta Gamma, where I served as Vice President of Member Education making me responsible for overseeing a committee of directors and the implementing 65 new members.</p>
           <p>When I’m not hard at work, you can find me unwinding in the kitchen with a cast iron in hand, or glued to the TV cheering on the Hokies.</p>
